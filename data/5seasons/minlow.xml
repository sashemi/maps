				<![CDATA[[[Genbu]](shou) is associated with jade and onyx. Every temple has a piece of an essence of a Divine Guardian Beast. People can visit the essence and pass some trials to receive a blessing. The supplicant is questioned before they can participate in the trial.

				Lythara, Aemund, Udex try to see if they can slip into temple trial grounds using magic, but they are chased out by priests. Temple is divine ground which prevents certain effects, like teleportation.]]>

				<![CDATA[A __Green Mansion__ is an entertainment house, common to large cities in Shou. The building has wide pillars supporting a terrace. A painting of a beautiful man and woman in embrace can be seen on a banner. People with red faces enter a wide open green door. There is a welcoming atmosphere, and sounds of classical music played on sitars. The sweet smell of perfume wafts out from every window and door.

				Just inside the entrace, men and women in nature-themed bath robes patterned with flowers, trees, and autumn colors. A short-haired plain female receptionist is looking through books, noting down names.

				Lythara's contact, named __Shager__, is a particularly charismatic korobokuru and the head courtesan of the __Petalâ€™s View__, a Mansion with many patrons. The Knights meet Shager and are told of a contact at the Aviary who can help Chao reach out to [[Red Rat]](tai_tung). Shager also provides an [[underground contact|tamiyo]](linshung) in __Linshung__.]]>
